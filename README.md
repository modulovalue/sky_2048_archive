## sky_2048_archive

(mid 2014)
2048 was popular back then and I thought what if there were a game where cubes would fall down from the sky and collapse following a similar logic that the game 2048 has?

It was supposed to become a game but I couldn't find good mechanics for such a concept so it became more of a 'passive experience'.

It's still playable on windows, just start test.exe
